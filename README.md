# Accident-Severity-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the severity of road accidents using historical traffic accident data. The goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that can classify accident severity levels based on contributing factors such as weather conditions, road type, time, and vehicle information.

The model helps in identifying high-risk conditions and supports data-driven decision-making for improving road safety.

Key Insights

Weather and road conditions significantly influence accident severity.

Random Forest performed better compared to other models due to handling non-linear relationships effectively.

Feature importance analysis helped identify critical risk factors.

Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Implement XGBoost for performance comparison

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
